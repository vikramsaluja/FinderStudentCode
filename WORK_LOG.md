| Oct 30  | 11:30-11:55am |  My orginal thoughts are to see if I can use a trie so that I will be able to organize the URLs. I am also thinking if I could create arraylists and then have an overall bucket of arrays to try and have a constant lookup. The issue with how to handle the memory which is the core part of this problem set is still something that I am not totally sure about how I might approach it. |
