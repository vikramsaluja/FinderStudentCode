| April 5 |    9-10pm     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Oct 30  | 11:30-11:55am |                                                                                                                                                 My orginal thoughts are to see if I can use a trie so that I will be able to organize the URLs. I am also thinking if I could create arraylists and then have an overall bucket of arrays to try and have a constant lookup. The issue with how to handle the memory which is the core part of this problem set is still something that I am not totally sure about how I might approach it. |
| Nov 2   |  5:00-6:00pm  |                                                                             I dont think that my previous approach makes much sense. Now I am trying to focus on how can I decrease the amount of memory that would be used, so if I used 2 arrays that are the same size and with one that stores the keys and another one that stores the values. This way it would be slightly more memory efficient. My thinking changed during this time by trying to see if I should look to remove any duplicates therefore I would need less memory. |
| Nov 2   | 8:45pm-9:10pm |                                                                              Building off of how I previously thought about using to seperate arrays, if I could use ints which require less data to be stored, this could decrease the amount of memory that would need to be allocated. I am not sure if that is a sufficient way to approach this problem or really work. My thinking is that if I can use a string or some other data structure to represent instead of larger data structures, it would make the memory more efficient. |
| Nov 3   |  9:05-9:55am  |               I am starting to think if I could try and turn a key into a number that points us closer to where the value should be. (So trying to use hashing). One thing that I am trying to think through would be if I can divide up the different data groups based on things like first letter of the string or converting part of to an int. I think that this would then help me narrow down where to look. I am not to sure how I would neccecarily decrease the amount of memory though which is the key part of this problem set. |
| Nov 8   | 8:50-10:00pm  | During this time I fully impletemented the resize() function. I was not totally sure how I was going to utilize this but I realized that the main purpose would be to double the table size and rehash all keys. My thinking changed since this function made me rethink how I wrote my add() function since it depended on hash(). This also then helped me realize that reseting numRecords = 0 before readding was necessay, otherwise it would reinserted which is what I orginally had, but doing this avoided it from being triggered. |
| Nov 10  |  8:15-9:00pm  |                                                                                                   When I added resizing I initially copied the arrays of keys = oldKeys directly without rehashing. I then realized that this mistake was making loojups fail since the old hash places were indvalid in the new tabe lsize. My thinking evolevd since I realized that the hash values depend strongly on the modulus and I needed to call add() again in for every reinsert. After I completed this and I able to complete the problem set. |
